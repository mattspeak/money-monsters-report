# 13. The Learning Loop

Gamification without a strategy creates a *reward loop*; engaging at first, then hollow. A deliberate learning loop — one where the same mechanics that reward progress also build knowledge and habit — is what turns a product into a practice users return to.

## Developing a Learning Loop System

- Knowledge alone doesn't change behavior — the [[4. Money Attitudes, Behaviors and Habits|Confidence Trap]] highlighted that learning attached to real situations is retained far better than abstract instruction.
- The [[7. Topics and Content|Topics and Content]] section built on this: effective learning requires Knowledge, Skills, and Habits working together per topic, and mapped the practice mechanics each topic needs:

	- Knowledge is what a lesson delivers (e.g. compound interest)
	- Skills are applied through scenario-based practice (e.g. identify who earns the most interest)
	- Habits require the loop to repeat (e.g. monthly reminder to save)

The **learning loop** describes the app's gamification functionality. It's a more purposeful way to think about gamification features across the Money Monsters app.

The learning loop consists of... **Learn → Practice → Progress → Return**

### Learn — The Lesson Content

**GOAL:** Attention held through engaging modalities and chunked content and user-relevant scenarios; users rewarded for reading carefully rather than clicking through mindlessly.

**CURRENT REALITY:** Lesson content is still in development; see [[7. Topics and Content]]. The format works when it lands — scenario-based dialogue is categorically different from text-heavy competitors and participants engaged with it consistently.

> *"I like that I have to pay attention and I don't just click through everything quickly, but that it's actually quite fun, that I read it and actually imagine the situation and I have to think a little bit too."* (Veronika, 13, CZ)

> *"The words are good because, like, I know what they all mean. It's not like a load of big money words."* (Aiden, 15, UK)

> *[Summary] She appreciated that lessons were presented through stories and scenarios, which made them easier to follow — though she expected clearer explanations of financial terms she hadn't encountered before.* (Vilma, 15, CZ)

**RECOMMENDATION:**

*V1 —* Make scenario-based, dialogue-driven lessons the primary creative vehicle. The "help this person decide" structure reduces perceived difficulty and invites reasoning rather than recall. Characters and scenarios must reflect 13–15 year old financial reality — pocket money amounts, social spending moments, near-term saving goals. Key information must be on the same screen as the decision that requires it.

*V2 —* Extend modality range: short animated or voice-narrated concept introductions, optional "go deeper" explainers after key questions, selective video/audio at scenario moments — particularly for Older Teens where scenario plausibility directly affects engagement.

### Practice — Lesson Interactivity

**GOAL:** Knowledge applied through scenario-based decisions and challenges immediately after it's delivered, so understanding consolidates into judgment rather than passive recall.

**CURRENT REALITY:** The research stimuli embedded applied practice moments — including selecting a new savings account after learning about compound interest, and choosing a priority debt to repay. These mechanics didn't need explaining or prompting: unprompted, many respondents highlighted them as a standout positive in the learning experience.

This confirms what the [[7. Topics and Content|Topics and Content]] section has mapped in detail: scenario-based practice is where learning consolidates, and the "help this person decide" format is the right vehicle. Branching decisions, allocation challenges, and swipe-to-sort mechanics all have specific topic mappings. The task now is building these in as permanent fixtures rather than research prototypes.

> *"They could improve the gameplay...spendable points, monster trading, map-based mini-games with financial consequences."* (Isaac, 13, UK)

> *"Yeah, I preferred it more like decision based."* (Dulcie, 16, UK)

> *[Summary] She would expect more visual dynamics and simulation elements — for example, simulated purchasing situations — to make practice feel more tangible.* (Katka, 15, CZ)

**RECOMMENDATION:**

*V1 —* Hardwire at least one applied practice moment into every lesson, using the topic-specific mechanics mapped in [[7. Topics and Content]]: branching decisions, allocation challenges, swipe-to-sort. Multiple choice alone asks users to pattern-match rather than reason — varied modalities are a learning design requirement, not an aesthetic one.

*V2 —* Expand the input modality range: drag-and-drop allocation, sliders, simulated product interfaces, tap-to-reveal. Build feasibility of these modalities into the technical spec early so they can be sequenced into the content roadmap rather than retrofitted.

### Progress — The Right Structure, Not Yet the Right Consequence

**GOAL:** Lesson completion translates into something tangible and directional — progress that builds toward something rather than trophies that accumulate without purpose.

**CURRENT REALITY:** Monsters and maps provide the right structural bones. Collection makes lesson completion visible; the visual path communicates structure, progress, and aspiration simultaneously. Locked content functions as aspiration rather than frustration — moderators observed participants tapping on greyed-out levels, wanting to reach them.

> *"It's making you want to keep going because you can like collect the maps... probably something more younger people do than older people."* (Olivia, 14, UK)

The gap is consequence: monsters are earned but, once collected, they do nothing. Althea (19, UK): *"'Monster Collected' felt like a gimmick because I didn't understand where it was leading."* Ariana (17, UK) cited the WeWard model — steps converted to redeemable points — as one version of tangible payoff; customisation unlocks were another. The specific mechanic matters less than the principle: **monsters should mark progress through the loop, not end it.**

> *"I do think it's quite a strong incentive because it might make you feel a bit competitive and you might want to collect all of the badges, get more than your friends."* (Ovie, 15, UK)

> *[Summary] He liked the idea of collecting monster characters and found it motivating — but suggested adding animations and a distinctive sound when unlocking rewards to make the moment feel more rewarding.* (Lukáš, 16, CZ)

*Collection has cross-segment reach — Enoch (18) and Mia (25) were both positive — but the mechanic functions most reliably as a motivator for Young Teens. For Older Teens and Young Adults, consequence matters more than collection. See [[9. The Key Design and Product Tensions|§9]] for visual execution detail.*

**RECOMMENDATION:**

*V1 —* Give collected monsters a second layer: unlock bonus content, a cosmetic, or a feature. Preview the next monster at lesson completion — name and appearance visible — to sustain forward pull. Add a brief content teaser to locked lessons so the progression map is aspirational, not just structural. XPs alongside streaks provide a cumulative progress layer that survives a missed day; visible and accumulating is sufficient for V1.

*V2 —* Mature the progress system into a spend layer: XPs become spendable on cosmetics, content unlocks, and competitive features. Consequence mechanics that make monster collection matter beyond the grid — trading, upgrading, content-gating — deepening engagement particularly for Older Teens.

### Return — Closing the Loop

**GOAL:** Users have a reason to come back — and something pulling them when internal motivation alone isn't enough.

**CURRENT REALITY:** Without something pulling users back, the loop breaks after Progress. Two mechanisms are currently absent.

**Consequence** — once monsters have a second layer, returning has purpose. Right now there's no reason to revisit a completed lesson or a collected character.

**Social pull** — participants expected competitive elements when increased gameplay was explored: leaderboards, streak comparisons, earning monsters alongside friends.

> *"If other people use it, I would definitely start using it."* — Levi (17, UK)

> *"When I do Duolingo for Spanish, I had like a two day streak and then I completely forgot to do it. But this — it's a bit more visual, so there's more likely a chance of me remembering to do it."* (Dulcie, 16, UK)

> *[Summary] She liked the streak feature, comparing it to Duolingo, and suggested social features including comparing progress with friends and maintaining a shared streak.* (Vilma, 15, CZ)

**Streaks** surface naturally as a Return mechanism and participants understand them — Duolingo has shaped the expectation. But unlike language learning, daily financial practice is harder to sustain once core lessons are complete, and the content depth needed to support a daily streak habit isn't yet there. For Young Adults especially, engagement is more likely situational — triggered by a financial moment — than daily routine. This tension is covered in [[9. The Key Design and Product Tensions|§9]]: Daily Habit vs. Situational Reference.

**RECOMMENDATION:**

*V1 —* Introduce XPs as a cumulative progress layer that survives a missed day, reducing the abandonment risk that streaks alone create. Consequence-based progression (see Progress above) provides the internal pull; streaks provide continuity scaffolding rather than the primary motivation.

*V2 —* Add the social layer in sequence: streak comparison with friends first, then friend group leaderboards, then public competitive features. Basic social features should be free — they are adoption and retention drivers. Competitive depth becomes a premium differentiator. Full situational routing (topic search, "what do you need today?" entry points) extends Return for older segments whose usage is pull-based rather than habit-based.
