# 15. Prioritised Recommendations

## Primary Recommendation: Launch for Young Teens (13–15)

The research establishes Young Teens as the **segment for launch**. With this segment, the aesthetic lands the most strongly, the initial, linear learning journey resonates, the gamification resonates.

Older Teens (16–18) need some work to convert; Young Adults (18–25) have structural mismatches that position them as a later audience (see [[12. Segment Verdicts and Launch Readiness]]).

**Therefore: v1 of Money Monsters should be optimised specifically for 13–15 year olds.** All content, scenarios, character situations, and tone decisions should center on this segment's financial reality — pocket money, social spending, near-term saving goals.

## v1 of Money Monsters: Launching with Young Teens

### 1. Topics and content

**Prioritise topics by importance to 13–15 year olds.** Content priorities differ meaningfully by age band (see section 4). For the YT segment, what appears first sets the expectation for everything that follows.

**Ensure lesson titles speak to a 13–15 year old's life.** Titles must signal relevance, not just label content. *"Why does my money keep disappearing?"* communicates more than *"Budgeting with Budgie."* 

**On topic navigation for v1.** A fully topic-first experience (lesson browsing, non-linear access) is not realistic for the v1 build though the team should make their best effort to allow users to navigate/revisit through topics/lessons/key definitions 

**Preview locked content.** The progression map signals future, more-advanced topics to encourage exploration. Add a brief content teaser (e.g. lesson start page) to each locked lesson so users have a reason to progress.

### 2. Lesson framing

**Make scenario-based, dialogue-driven lessons the primary creative vehicle.** This is the product's strongest asset. The "help this person decide" structure reduces perceived difficulty and invites reasoning rather than recall. 

**Characters and scenarios must reflect 13–15 year old lives.** Characters' age, income level, and life situation must match the target user. E.g. pocket-money amounts (£5–£20 decisions), social spending moments, near-term saving goals.

**Clarify character identity from the first interaction.** Players must know whether they are inhabiting or advising the character — and this must hold consistently. Mr. Money works as an app guide but lesson characters are just as important. 

**Start with a personalisation quiz, not an assessment.** Use behavioural and situational questions over definitional tests. For 13–15 year olds this means: questions about pocket money, social spending decisions, and saving habits — not abstract defintions, credit, or formal income scenarios.

**Keep the onboarding quiz to 5–7 questions for Young Teens.** Brief enough to avoid abandonment before users reach the app's core experience. Position Mr. Money explicitly as a reassuring/friendly guide.

### 3. Lesson experience

**Key information at the point of decision.** The critical detail a learner needs to answer a question must be on the same screen as the question — not recalled from the screen before.

**Explain every answer, right or wrong.** Brief, plain-language explanations should follow every response. Being told why you're right is as valuable as being told why you're wrong.

**Avoid calculation-heavy questions.** 13–15 year olds engage better with reasoning and choice than arithmetic. Build any numerical context into the scenario framing itself rather than requiring mental maths to answer.

**Tap-for-definition across the app.** Users should never need to leave the app to understand a word in it. Extend the existing overlay mechanic consistently to onboarding, lessons, and the topic map. (Critical need evidenced in CZ — financial terminology confusion appeared across multiple interviews.)


**Quick-win Learning Loop mechanics:**

- **XPs alongside streaks** — a cumulative progress layer that survives a missed day. Visible and accumulating is enough for v1; they don't need to be spendable yet. (Particularly valued in CZ — one participant independently proposed coin-based customization system.)
- **Monsters with consequence** — a collected monster that unlocks something (bonus content, a cosmetic, a feature) is more compelling than one that simply appears in a grid. (Strong evidence in CZ — participants wanted monsters to do something, not just collect.)
- **Progress indicator on the onboarding quiz** — a simple completion bar. Minor implementation effort; disproportionate impact on abandonment.
- **Preview the next monster at lesson completion** — show name and appearance to sustain forward pull. A display change, not a system change.

### 4. Goal-setting feature

**Scope a lightweight native goal-tracker for v1.** The research consistently evidences demand for a place to set savings goals and track progress — particularly for Young Teens, whose primary jobs are saving toward something specific and making money last. The app teaches the principles but lacks the mechanics. Even a minimal goal-tracker (name a goal, set a target amount, track progress) would materially increase utility and time-in-app.

**If native build is out of scope for v1:** explore linking out to an existing savings or budgeting tool as an interim bridge. The gap is real regardless of how it's closed.

**Queue full budgeting functionality for v2+** — budget planning, spending categorisation, and multi-goal tracking represent meaningful additional scope. Prioritise the goal-tracker in v1; the fuller budgeting layer can follow.

### 5. Development approach

Before committing to new prototypes or builds, work through the core design decisions in low-fidelity first — a digital whiteboard session rather than a coded prototype. Get the following right for 13–15 year olds, then test with users from this segment before moving into development:

- **Topic selection and sequencing** — which topics matter most to 13–15 year olds, in what order
- **Lesson framing** — characters and scenarios that reflect their financial reality (pocket money, social spending, near-term goals)
- **Decision design** — choices that match their actual money decisions and reasoning patterns

This is a faster, cheaper route to getting the fundamentals right — and the fundamentals are what the research shows matter most.

## Distribution Model: Near-Term Implications of the Push Route

A decision toward institutional distribution is not purely commercial — it has product, content, and partnership development implications that need to be resolved before the v1 build finalises, not after.

### Technical flexibility

- **White-label or embed capability needs scoping now.** Bank and school partners will expect branded delivery — the Doshi model deploys as embedded web components within an existing bank app in under a week. Assess whether this path is viable vs. a standalone co-branded app.
- **Reporting and safeguarding requirements differ by route.** Schools will require progress data, usage reporting, and age-appropriate data handling (UK GDPR, under-13 safeguarding). Banks will require compliance sign-off on any financial content before deployment.
- **Admin/dashboard layer.** Institutional partners need a way to monitor usage and demonstrate impact — a teacher or CSR manager view, even a basic one, is likely a pre-condition of partnership.

### Proposition design

- **A B2B pitch layer needs to be developed alongside the consumer proposition.** What does the institution get? Banks: customer acquisition tool and CSR mandate fulfilment. Schools: curriculum-aligned PSHE resource, free, ready-to-deploy.
- **Co-branding needs designing into the UX now.** Endorsement must feel visible to the end user — trust transfer from a bank or school is only valuable if users can see it. Retrofitting co-branding post-launch is harder than designing for it from the start.
- **The consumer proposition and the institutional pitch are not the same thing.** "Money Stuff Nobody Explains" is the user-facing hook; "gamified financial literacy tool, curriculum-aligned, free to deploy, reaches young people you're already serving" is the institutional pitch. Both need to exist.

### Content priorities

- **School-route content should align to PSHE and Citizenship topic areas** and accommodate term-based pacing — not just daily streaks. The Czech market is further ahead here: financial literacy has been mandatory in the national curriculum since 2013.
- **Bank-route content should map to account-opening triggers and financial firsts** — first card, first job, first savings account. Topic-based entry points matter more than sequential lesson progression in this context.
- **Both routes require content that works unsupported.** The classroom and the bank app are self-serve contexts — content must be fully legible without a teacher, parent, or guide to facilitate.

## Queue for Version 2+

These are genuine product priorities, clearly evidenced by the research. They represent expansion beyond the 13–15 year old core — either deepening engagement mechanics for that segment or extending reach to Older Teens (16–18) and Young Adults (18–25). Organised in the same sequence: content and navigation first, then lesson experience, then broader engagement and reach.

### Topics: non-linear access and situational routing

Add a situational entry point — topic index, search, or "what do you need today?" routing — as a parallel path alongside the progression map. The two models are not mutually exclusive; they require different front-door design.

Connect quiz answers to genuinely differentiated content pools: a student sees overdraft and budgeting content; a first-job user sees payslips and tax basics; a user moving out sees renting and utility costs. The quiz already asks the right questions — v2 makes the personalisation real. Extend quiz length adaptively for older segments (7–10 questions for 16–18 and 18–25 users) so the personalisation is both deeper and more credible.

### Lesson experience: more interactive question formats

Build feasible input modalities into the question mix: drag-and-drop allocation, sliders, simulated product interfaces, tap-to-reveal. Multiple choice alone asks users to pattern-match rather than reason. These are learning design improvements, not aesthetic ones. (Appetite for this confirmed in CZ — at least one YT participant requested typed answer options to break MCQ monotony.)

### The Learning Loop and social layer

Mature the v1 mechanics into a system: a spend layer for XPs (cosmetics, content unlocks, competitive features), and consequence mechanics that make monster collection matter beyond the grid. (Strong demand in CZ for streak protection/freeze feature to prevent abandonment after missed days.)

Add the social layer in sequence: streak comparison with friends first, then friend group leaderboards, then public competitive features. Basic social features should be free — they are adoption and retention drivers. Competitive depth can be a premium differentiator.

### Age-differentiated visual themes and guide options

Develop a visual skin for the 16–18 segment — more minimal, less toy-like — that preserves the progression and collection architecture under a different aesthetic register. This would materially expand the addressable audience without a structural redesign. (Note: CZ data shows some 13-15 year olds also find current aesthetic too childish — 2 of 4 YT participants — suggesting this tension exists even within the core launch segment.) A full Young Adult skin is a longer-term commitment.

Allow guide character customisation for older segments. Several participants — particularly in CZ — wanted to choose their guide or switch from Mr. Money to a monster character. A character selection step post-quiz, or the ability to change guide in settings, directly addresses the teacher-student dynamic that Older Teens and Young Adults found off-putting. For 16+ users, a peer-level dialogue variant or distinct guide character is likely sufficient; a full new character is a longer-term build.
