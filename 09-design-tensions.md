# 9. The Key Design and Product Tensions

These are not feature-level problems — they are structural tensions in the product's identity. Resolving one without attending to the others risks creating new contradictions.

---

## One App, Three Audiences

The app spans a 13–25 age range containing three audiences with fundamentally incompatible expectations:

- **14–16 (V1 bullseye):** Want a game that teaches. Low financial anxiety, high tolerance for playful aesthetics. Monster theme lands; the design registers as *for me*, not *for a younger kid*. Aesthetic, gamification, and content relevance converge here more than anywhere else.
- **16–19 (V2 target):** Acutely sensitive to anything that positions them as younger. Accept the gamification architecture but resist the visual register. Content and proposition land strongly; the retention architecture isn't yet ready to support them.
- **20–25 (deprioritise):** Want a credible reference. Playful design lowers initial barriers but sacrifices the credibility that makes sustained engagement worthwhile. Usage pattern is situational, not habitual — a structural mismatch with the current model.

Note: **12–13 should also be deprioritised** for V1. Money is still abstract at this age — with no independent income and no live financial decisions, the app's scenario-based mechanics have no real-world anchor to attach to. The full case is in [[6. Segment Verdicts]].

Ratings reflect the gradient: 14–16 score highest (8–9/10); 16–19 rate 7–8.5/10; 20–25 rate 4–7/10. The design choices that work for 14–16 are precisely the ones that undermine credibility for 20–25.

> *"I really like it because it makes it seem like you're working towards something."* (Sam, 14, UK)
>
> *"Well, more that it's like for kids. I think it's more for the younger ones."* (Veronika, 13, CZ)
>
> *"Well, my first impression is that it looks a lot like Duolingo. And maybe too childish for me... those monsters seem so childish to me, more for children... I would have it made more colorful. I would lighten it more, because I don't like that dark green very much. And instead of those monsters, put there... something else."* (Ladislav, 13, CZ)
>
> *"I might put normal people there instead of monsters... monsters are just like. I don't want to insult the app, but it's just childish, like for a five-year-old child."* (Jan, 16, CZ)

This doesn't require three separate products — it requires a deliberate choice about primary audience and accepting the consequences. **14–16 is the clearest V1 product-market fit**, but that has implications for positioning, distribution, and the school-partnerships model.

**Implications → See [[15. Prioritised Recommendations]]:** V1 content, scenarios, character situations, and tone should centre on the 14–16 financial reality. A visual skin for 16–19 is a high-priority V2 investment.

## Playful vs. Credible

Playfulness and credibility pull in opposite directions. Young adults especially believe that the topic of money carries specific credibility requirements that other learning domains don't — getting savings or debt decisions wrong has real consequences.

- The monster aesthetic signals approachability but undermines trust for older users
- "Money Monsters" commits to a playful register at the identity level — visual and content design carries the full burden of communicating seriousness
- For 14–16 this trade-off is acceptable; for 20–25 it is decisive
- A resolution exists: mature the visual layer while preserving the gamification architecture — decouple the playful aesthetic from the structural mechanics

> *"There should be some seriousness — it's an important topic."* (Althea, 19, UK)
>
> *"If something's important, you need to do it — you should be able to do it without giving you a sense of dopamine rush."* (Mohammad, 23, UK)

Jan's observation sharpens the underlying issue: the tension is not simply *playful vs. serious* — it is **playful vs. childish**. These are not the same thing. Monopoly is deeply playful — it uses colour, game mechanics, chance, and stakes — and is credible across ages precisely because its aesthetic signals *fun*, not *young*. Sesame Street is also playful, but its visual register signals a specific developmental audience. Money Monsters currently sits closer to Sesame Street than to Monopoly — and for 16+ users, that positioning creates a trust deficit before a single lesson is completed.

The implication is encouraging: the route to credibility is not about removing playfulness. It is about **upgrading the type of playfulness** — more Monopoly, less Sesame Street. The structural mechanics (progression, collection, streaks) are already there; the question is what visual register dresses them.

> *"I might put normal people there instead of monsters... monsters are just like. I don't want to insult the app, but it's just childish, like for a five-year-old child."* (Jan, 16, CZ)

**Implications → See [[15. Prioritised Recommendations]]:** No visual redesign is required for the 14–16 V1 bullseye. A more minimal, less toy-like visual variant for 16–19 is a V2 priority and would materially expand the addressable audience without structural redesign. → Detail on how the current aesthetic lands across segments in [[10. First Impressions & Visual Comprehension]].

## Daily Habit vs. Situational Reference

Getting anyone to adopt a new, sustained daily habit is genuinely hard — and it is worth asking what "daily habit" actually means here, and whether that is the right aspiration for this topic.

The Duolingo comparison participants reach for is instructive — but misleading:

- Language learning is **evergreen**: daily practice always adds value, content is inexhaustible, and the skill degrades without use — streaks fit this naturally
- Financial literacy is **front-loaded**: once you understand compound interest or how an ISA works, there is limited value in revisiting it daily — the application is situational, triggered by life events not calendar habits
- Younger participants' confidence about daily use should be read cautiously — habitual engagement is easy to imagine in a session; harder to sustain when the content runs out

This raises a practical question: even if a user intends daily engagement, what is the realistic arc? 30 days? 90 days? The content may run out before the habit solidifies — and a habit built on a finite curriculum is more fragile than one built on an inexhaustible skill.

What "daily habit" looks like also matters. A gentle daily push notification — like a word-of-the-day prompt — asks very little and is plausibly sustained. A 15–20 minute Duolingo-style session asks significantly more from a topic that doesn't naturally generate daily urgency. For Money Monsters, the lighter end of the habit spectrum may be more realistic as a retention model — and designing explicitly for that may serve the product better than targeting an engagement frequency the topic can't support.

These dynamics map differently across segments:

- **Habit-based users (14–16):** Forward-looking — what comes next, what do I unlock? School routines support daily engagement; streaks and progression create momentum. The app's current architecture suits this pattern well. The open question is how long the content arc sustains daily engagement before novelty exhausts it.
- **Pull-based users (20–25):** Situational and event-triggered — does this apply to me right now? The streak mechanic penalises absence; locked progression excludes users arriving with a specific question. The current model structurally excludes this usage pattern.
- The two models are not mutually exclusive, but require different design features to coexist

A situational entry point — topic index, searchable glossary, or "what do you need today?" routing — would serve pull-based users without dismantling the streak architecture.

> *"It makes it seem like you're working towards something."* (Sam, 14, UK — on daily streaks)
>
> *"I would use it when facing specific financial decisions — not every day."* (Grace, 19, UK)

Without a situational entry point, a significant slice of the intended audience is structurally excluded from meaningful engagement.

**Implications → See [[15. Prioritised Recommendations]]:** V1 streak and progression architecture is fit for the 14–16 bullseye. A situational entry point (topic search or index) is a V2 priority. → Detail on gamification mechanics in [[13. The Learning Loop]].

## Guided Learning Path vs. User-Driven Topic Selection

The app's sequential architecture assumes users want to be taken on a guided journey — but many users, particularly older ones, want to navigate directly to what matters to them right now.

The current experience:
- Lessons unlock in sequence, creating a linear progression
- Content is gated — earlier stages must be completed before later material is accessible
- The learning path is determined by the app, not the user's immediate needs

This works well for **14–16 year olds**, who appreciate structure and enjoy the sense of unlocking progression — but a significant portion of users, especially **16–19 and 20–25**, resist this model:

- They arrive with **specific questions** triggered by real situations: *"I'm buying a car, how do I compare finance options?"* or *"What's the difference between an ISA and a savings account?"*
- They want **topic-based navigation**: the ability to browse by theme (savings, borrowing, investing) and drill into granular subtopics
- Linear progression feels **restrictive** when they already understand some concepts but not others — forcing them through basics to reach advanced content creates friction
- The locked structure **excludes situational users** who need an answer today, not after completing five prerequisite lessons

> *"I dislike being restricted or needing to complete things to move forward — I want to jump to what's relevant to me."* (Zain, 20, UK)
>
> *"Topic categories with clickable lessons — so I can address specific situations I'm facing."* (Grace, 19, UK)

To serve a broad audience, Money Monsters ultimately needs **two pathways**:

- **Guided path:** For users who want to build knowledge systematically and enjoy unlocking progression (14–16, habit-based learners)
- **Topic index / search:** For users arriving with a specific question and needing direct access (16–25, situational learners, those with uneven prior knowledge)

**Implications → See [[15. Prioritised Recommendations]]:** Non-linear topic access is a V2 priority. V1 should optimise the guided path for 14–16, with a best-effort navigation improvement (topic revisit, glossary access) recommended even for V1 launch. → More on lesson architecture in [[11. Onboarding]] and [[12. Lesson Experience - Learning Mechanics and Comprehension]].
